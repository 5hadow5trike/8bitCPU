CLK
Delay:
#0: 
-Fetch instr.
-Update instr. counter(Check for jmp conditions)
#1:
-Sets write_enable of reg_bank
-decides between immediate or reg for command
-chooses data_in of reg_bank between SET command and ALU command
#2:
-Output reg2 and reg3
-Output current SREG1(probably unnecessary compare #4)
#3:
-ALU calculates arithmetic operation
-Handle flag condition in ALU
#4:
-Write result back to reg
-Write current flag to output
